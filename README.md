# SearchPhotos
This iPhone app takes advantage of the Flickr API to search their public photos. The returned photos are displayed in a grid using a UICollectionView. Once the photos are loaded in the grid, you can click on any photo to see the full image in a single view.

### Latest revisions are:
  - Updated to Swift 3.0
  - Now uses OperationQueue instead of GCD
  - Implemented UISearchController 
  - Implemented continuous loading of images
